# ARK_Starmap
### An offline version of the ARK Starmap website -> https://robertsspaceindustries.com/starmap made with Unity 
The ARK Starmap website is the official map of the Star Citizen universe (as planned by the lore). It includes all the known star systems and their celestial bodies in a 3D environment for everyone to explore. 
This app is a remake of this website with the goal of adding more features like concept-arts, wiki links, translations, an atlas of the celestial body and more...
